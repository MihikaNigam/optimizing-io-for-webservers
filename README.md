# optimizing-io-for-webservers
This research [thesis](https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/3037/) aims to optimize http webservers and analyze performance on existing webservers.

Uses IO_URING


Client Sends HTTP Request -> packets arrive at NIC -> NIC triggers an interrupt to notify kernel -> the driver collects these packets -> req passes thru tcp/ip stacks-> network management places queue is reqâ€™s socket buffer -> webserver calls recv to read the req -> kernel returns the HTTP request data to the user-space
